 * Setting this field lets you determine whether users will receive notifications when you include mentions in the message content, or the content of components attached to that message.
 * This field is always validated against your permissions and the presence of said mentions in the message, to avoid "phantom" pings where users receive a notification without a visible mention in the message.
 * For example, if you want to ping everyone, including it in this field is not enough, the mention format ({@code @everyone}) must also be present in the content of the message or its components.
 * <br>
 * To mention roles and notify their members, the role's mentionable field must be set to true
 * Setting the {@link io.github._4drian3d.jdwebhooks.webhook.WebHook.Builder#suppressNotifications(Boolean)} flag
 * when sending a message will disable push notifications and only cause a notification badge
